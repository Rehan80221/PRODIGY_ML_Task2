📊 Task Completed: K-means Clustering to Group Retail Store Customers Based on Purchase History 📊
I'm excited to share a recent project where I utilized K-means clustering to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. This task was part of a learning exercise aimed at enhancing my data science and machine learning skills.
🛠️ Steps Undertaken:
Environment Setup:
Set an environment variable to avoid memory leak issues before any sklearn import.
Suppressed specific sklearn warnings related to K-means clustering.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Loaded the dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
Selected relevant features for clustering: Annual Spend, Frequency of Purchase, and Average Purchase Value.
K-means Clustering:
Applied K-means clustering with 3 clusters and multiple initializations to ensure stable and consistent results.
Visualized the clusters and their centroids to better understand the grouping.
Comparison with Hierarchical Clustering:
Applied Agglomerative Clustering with 3 clusters to compare the results with K-means.
Visualized the clusters formed by Hierarchical Clustering.
📈 Visualizations:
Created scatter plots to visualize the clusters formed by both K-means and Agglomerative Clustering.
Highlighted cluster centroids to illustrate the central tendency of each cluster.
🧠 Knowledge Gained:
Feature Selection: Learned the importance of selecting meaningful features that significantly impact clustering results.
Cluster Validation: Understood different methods (Elbow, Silhouette) to determine and validate the optimal number of clusters.
Algorithm Comparison: Gained insights into how different clustering algorithms (K-means vs. Hierarchical) perform on the same dataset.
Visualization: Enhanced skills in visualizing clustering results using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
